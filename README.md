## Model Training

The AI model behind CartoonGen generates cartoon faces from text prompts using **Stable Diffusion v1.5**, fine-tuned with **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**.  

We trained the model on a curated cartoon face dataset, using the **CLIP text encoder** to understand the prompts and a **UNet denoiser** to transform the latent representation into cartoon-style images. A **VAE** was used to encode and decode images during training and inference, helping the model capture the cartoon style effectively.
